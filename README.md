# Working as a Data Analyst at Accenture
  As a Data Analyst at Accenture, I work with different clients and on various projects. This keeps my job interesting since i will always encounter new problems to 
  solve and new topics to learn about.

# The Business
  The Business refers to both our clients and our internal team members who aren't involved in detailed data analysis. They depend on your analysis to make important business 
  decisions. Not everyone will have a strong understanding of data, so your job is to explain your findings in a simple and clear way that everyone can understand.
# The Data
  The Data includes all the relevant sources that i will clean, process, and analyze to find useful insights for the business.

# Getting Started with Social Buzz
  My first task is to read the brief from Social Buzz and complete a short knowledge check before the call.

  Mae Mulligan, one of Accentureâ€™s Managing Directors, is leading the Social Buzz project. She has reviewed the brief and assembled a team of Accenture experts to work on it.

  Mae has scheduled a project kickoff call with the Accenture team for tomorrow morning. Before the call, she has shared the project brief so you can understand what Social 
  Buzz needs help with.

# What i Need to Do :
  **Understand the Client and Business Problem:** Read the brief to grasp the client's needs and the business challenges they face.

**Identify Project Requirements:** Determine what needs to be delivered for this project.

**Focus on my Role:** As a Data Analyst, pinpoint the tasks i should concentrate on.
