# Working as a Data Analyst at Accenture
  As a Data Analyst at Accenture, I work with different clients and on various projects. This keeps my job interesting since i will always encounter new problems to 
  solve and new topics to learn about.

# The Business
  The Business refers to both our clients and our internal team members who aren't involved in detailed data analysis. They depend on your analysis to make important 
  business 
  decisions. Not everyone will have a strong understanding of data, so your job is to explain your findings in a simple and clear way that everyone can understand.
# The Data
  The Data includes all the relevant sources that i will clean, process, and analyze to find useful insights for the business.

# Getting Started with Social Buzz
  My first task is to read the brief from Social Buzz and complete a short knowledge check before the call.

  Mae Mulligan, one of Accenture’s Managing Directors, is leading the Social Buzz project. She has reviewed the brief and assembled a team of Accenture experts to work on it.

  Mae has scheduled a project kickoff call with the Accenture team for tomorrow morning. Before the call, she has shared the project brief so you can understand what Social 
  Buzz needs help with.

# What i Need to Do :
  **Understand the Client and Business Problem:** Read the brief to grasp the client's needs and the business challenges they face.

**Identify Project Requirements:** Determine what needs to be delivered for this project.

**Focus on my Role:** As a Data Analyst, pinpoint the tasks i should concentrate on.

**Industry experts** in the social media space to ensure we accurately understand Social Buzz’s sector.
**IPO experts** who will deliver on the IPO requirement
**Data experts** who will provide Big Data insights and content category analysis. This is where you sit!

  So, let’s have a look at what data i have to work with. The client has sent through:
**7 data sets** - each data set contains different columns and values
**A data model** - this shows the relationships between all of the data sets, as well as any links that you can use to merge tables.
  There is a lot of information here and it’s easy to get lost in the data. So, to make sure i will using the right data to answer the business questions i have to follow 
  these **steps:**
  1- Requirements gathering
  2- Data cleaning
  3- Data modelling

First up, requirements gathering

  As i mentioned, i have been sent 7 datasets and a data model.
  Often i won’t need all these datasets to find what i am looking for.
  So, the first step is to **use  data model to identify which datasets will be required to answer your business question** - which is to to figure out the **top 5 
  categories with the largest popularity.**

# presentation Structure and what i have to Analyse
  We know that the client wants to understand the top 5 content categories. Have a think about what are the best ways to present this? In a pie chart? In a bar chart?
  There are also some other interesting insights that we might want to share with them. 
  **For example:** 
  
  How many unique categories are there?
  
  How many reactions are there to the most popular category?
  
  What was the month with the most posts?
